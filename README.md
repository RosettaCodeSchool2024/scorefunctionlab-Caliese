In this lab I learned to find score functions, total and specific ones, and how to incorporate what we did in the labs yesterday to analyze energy between residues, etc.
One question I still have is when getting the score function for a protein-protein interaction, do we only find the score function for the parts that are interacting or of the whole molecule?
